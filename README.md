# Sonos
This app adds support for Sonos devices, e.g. Play/Pause, Previous, Next, Mute/Unmute & Volume control.

# Media (compatible with Homey v1.2.0 and higher)
Sonos now also supports Homey Media! This makes it possible to play playlists from Homey Media to the Sonos. 
Features of this app in combination with Homey Media include:
Play a Sonos playlist on Sonos
Play tracks from the Spotify/Soundcloud app to Sonos
Play mixed source playlists from Homey Media

### Known bugs
Playback of tracks from the Google Play Music app is not possible with Sonos due to the restricted API's. 
It is possible to play your Google Play Music tracks on Sonos by creating a Sonos Playlist which Homey can play on your Sonos speaker!
